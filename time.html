                  <p>
                    My name is Linyao Wang. I was raised in China, and I have been in America for seven years. I love traditional Chinese History, including old language, poetry, art, and music, because my family inspired me. I put some Traditional Chinese words into my digital graphic to compare the modern art material. I also like taking photos and shooting because I love to capture the beauty of objects globally and explore the meaning of life. Each photo represents a story, time, place, and people. When I look back at each photo from a long time ago, it will have different meaning and let me think about the past story and change of the time.</p>

                  <h3>Project Statement</h3>
                  <p>I made four digital photographs on Photoshop called <i>Time.</i> They are about time; past, present, and future. We are unable to catch the time. The like of everything is limited, even a planet, space, and universal. We do have a process of time, we were born as an infant, keep growing to a child, teenager, adult, older man and dieâ€¦... We need time; we need to grab it, catch it, and chase it. However, nobody can compete with time; we can do nothing; we only can create the value of time and cherish it.</p>
