                  <h3>Artist Statement</h3>
                  <p>Hanjing (Angel) Zheng was born in China and immigrated to the United States at the age of 7. Angel’s family moved to the states to provide a better future for the family, leaving everything they knew behind. English is Angel’s third language, leaving a gap of communication that Angel found filled by photographs. A picture tells a million words and when Angel found photography, it was like finding the missing piece she finally needed to capture her thoughts and share them with others. Angel particularly enjoys shooting high fashion editorials and portrait photography. Angel’s past works dealt a lot with our current screen based society and its relationship to the world of image-making. Angel examines our society’s performance behind the theme of social images.
                    <p>
                      Angel currently owns music studios throughout New York City, runs a blog (www.welldressedwellfedblog.com) and a clothing brand (www.izi.com). She works in both digital and analog photography, loves exploring the world, and good food, which is all documented in her blog. She currently lives in New York City with her bunny Mochi.
