                  <h3>Artist Statement</h3>
                  <p>My name is Austin Introna, I’m a half Italian/half Malaysian kid raised in New York. For the last four years, I primarily use graphic design and interactive to talk about family,
the role of marketing in new media, and gameplay. My work is heavily influenced by video
games and there are certain themes like family and culture that I try and feature throughout my
portfolio. Growing up in a half Italian half Malaysian household, the members of my large family
tree are all unique and have had some kind of impact on me and my life. Having family
members from both sides of my family, it’s made me more comfortable being different from
everyone else and it’s definitely made me more open to trying new things. Experiencing both
cultures has definitely shaped who I am today.</p>
                  <br>
                  <h3>Project Statement</h3>
                  <p>“The Family Attic” is an assortment of different pixelated items representing
members of my family and a brief narrative of their favorite story within the family. Each pixelated object represents a metaphor of what they mean to me and their role within the family.
After taking a considerable amount of time to come up with a single object to represent each
and every person in my family, the overall picture should depict a very cluttered attic. The
nostalgia of the attic evokes various memories and experiences with my family. You’ll notice that
every object has its own signature animation after you click on it, which is a callback to those old
flash games I played as a kid.</p>
