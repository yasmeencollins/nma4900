                  <h3>Artist Statement</h3>
                  <p>Linda Qibing Li is born in Guangdong, China, and raised in Brooklyn, New York. She is a
first-generation immigrant. She adapts quickly to new environments; she navigates between
cultures with understanding and appreciation as she assimilates to new life in America. Her work
talks about one’s collective and personal struggles and obstacles in the 21st century. These
struggles include feeling lost and overwhelmed with stress. Linda uses animation and sounds to
explore themes relating to self and nature.</p>
                  <br>
                  <h3>Project Statement</h3>
                  <p>Even the most charismatic people experience days where they are feeling lost and feeling
emptiness in life. Amid COVID-19, people are experiencing some loss and loneliness through
social distancing and various activities. We all have these feelings from time to time. These
feelings are personal, so everyone’s experience will be different. Having these feelings can harm
one’s mental health, especially if these feelings have lasted for a long time.
“Lost” is an animation work created by Linda Qibing Li. In the animation “Lost”, the negative
feelings are illustrated as balloons. Balloons are known to symbolize the act of letting go or
holding on. In this case, balloons are represented as negative emotions and feelings. Ballon’s will
be popped through the healing process, and the character is detaching the balloons and moving
on in life. As human beings, we tend to experience negative feelings from time to time; I feel it is
essential to release all these feelings and move forward in life.
