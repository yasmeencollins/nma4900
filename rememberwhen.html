                  <h3>Project Statement</h3>
                  <p>Technology itself has revolutionized the idea of journaling as there is this overarchingdependency on mobile devices and the internet. Now, whenever someone wants to recall what they did or what happened on a certain day, they simply go on through their phones first. Reminiscent of the difficult and different time spent in 2020, <a href ="https://editor.p5js.org/wyc21/present/Y9uGCLHRC" target="_blank">Remember When...</a> by Wan Yi Chen is a digitalized journal designed in Canva and created in p5.j that documents the artist’s recollection of the past year. With regrets of not keeping a physical written journal, the artist explores various record keeping forms of media that are familiar to almost everyone. The piece itself contains personal pictures, videos, and text messages collected by the artist. It also displays a series of news articles and relatable social media posts that represent this collective journey everyone has gone through in 2020. Designed to look like a journal and act like a computer, each month is separated into their own section where users can click on a specific month to browse through the different content featured.</p>
