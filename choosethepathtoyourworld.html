                  <h3>Artist Statement</h3>
                  <p>Momina is a New York-based artist who loves to capture the world in a shutter of sound. Her passion for photography developed as a child when she used to go through her family photo albums. Her most valuable possession as a kid was her toy camera and as an adult an actual camera that she used to seize both happy and sad moments. Her work is primarily portrait and nature photography; she loves to travel to places that hold the natural beauty of the planet and capturing moments of people that remind her of her family photographs. 
                  </p>
                  <p>Momina started to manipulate photographs using Adobe Photoshop to create optical illusions so that people can use their imagination to devise unique interpretations of her photographs, just like she used to have imaginative interpretations of her family photo albums as a kid. In regards to creating these illusions, she combines multiple images to create a multi-layered photograph that depicts a sentiment. The sentiments are created from her everyday experiences as a young enthusiast who loves to spend time with her family, travel, eat delicious food, and capture her life moments in a photograph. Presently, her work is digitally manipulating photographs as she tries to bring her imagination come to life through her trickery deception in photos.
